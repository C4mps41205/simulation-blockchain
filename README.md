<h1> About this project </h1><br>
this project is a simple example of how the blockchain works. A some days ago i was trying to learn new things and i made this with JavaScript.<br><br>
Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that allows for secure, transparent, and tamper-proof transactions without the need for a centralized intermediary. Essentially, it's a digital ledger of transactions that is distributed across a network of computers, and every participant in the network has a copy of the ledger. This decentralized approach to record-keeping makes it difficult for any one entity to manipulate the data.

At its core, a blockchain is a chain of blocks, where each block contains a set of transactions. When a new transaction occurs, it is verified by a network of computers called nodes. If the majority of nodes agree that the transaction is valid, it is added to a new block, which is then linked to the previous block in the chain. This creates an unbreakable chain of transactions that is secure and immutable.

To maintain the integrity of the blockchain, each block is cryptographically secured using complex mathematical algorithms. This means that once a block has been added to the chain, it cannot be altered or deleted without being detected by the network. In addition, each block contains a unique code, known as a hash, which helps to identify it and ensures that it is in the correct sequence within the chain.

The decentralized nature of blockchain also means that there is no need for a central authority to manage the transactions. Instead, every participant in the network is responsible for verifying and validating transactions. This creates a trustless system where no one entity has complete control over the network, and transactions can be processed quickly and securely.
<h1> What is the point </h1><br>
basically the point i's show how I understood what is and how the blockchain technology works.
<h1> finally... </h1><br>
you can take my code if you were inspired with him. Enjoy :D
